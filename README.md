# Pix
A tiny Paint-like app to draw pixels.

Learning Qt by doing.

## Build
First, install Qt5 (Ubuntu 22+):
```sh
sudo apt-get install qtbase5-dev qtchooser qt5-qmake qtbase5-dev-tools
```

Then, build the project:
```
qmake && make
```

If everything goes well, you should see a `pix` executable.
